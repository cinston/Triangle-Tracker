# Triangle-Tracker
# Program Description
This appliication allows one to identify types of triangles by entering any desired dimensions and it will tell the person whether the dimensions add up up to an Equlateral triangle, Isosceles or Scalene.
# Setup Instructions
clone the link from my github under the title above and then run it on any desired browser.
# Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
# A break down of the project individual behaviours
1- if the sum of two parameters is equal or exceeds the value of the third parameter, then the program will detect that the values do not form a realist triangle. *input - first value (6), second value (8), third value (15) *output - values do not match a triangle. 2- if the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would recognize that the values form an equilateral triangle. *input - first value (5), second value (5), third value (5) *output - Triangle is Equilateral. 3- if two values in the input are equal, whereas the third value is different, then the program would recognize that the values make up an isosceles triangle. *input - first value (5), second value (5), third value(7) *output - Triangle is Isosceles. 4- if the values entered differ but still make up a realistic triangle, then the program will be able to recognize that the values make up a Scalene triangle. *input - first value (3), second value (4), third value (5) *output- Triangle is Scalene.
